# Mall customers segmentation 
Using a clustering model to analyze mall customer profiles.


## The data set

The dataset contains 200 register of mall customers profiles.

The original one can be found in kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python).

My adapted version has 4 columns: `| is_male | age | annual-income | spending-score |`
